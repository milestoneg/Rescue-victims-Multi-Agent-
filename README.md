# Rescue-victims-Multi-Agent-
COMP329 Assessment 2
## Problem Description
The scenario is as follows: a doctor agent has information about 5 possible locations of 3 victims in a given area.  Both agents have a map of the arena and know of the location of possible obstacles.  The doctor directs the scout agent to look for the victims in these locations with the smallest number of moves possible.  Once three victims have been found (and the severity of their injuries has been assessed), the mission ends, at which point the doctor reports back the location of the victims.  However, a complicating factor is that the scout doesnâ€™t know its starting position, and thus needs to figure this out.
